# Complements of the expriment results

## Feature category effectiveness

In the article, we mentioned that we test the different combinations of the proposed feature categories and we showed the results of random forest algorithm in the article, here we also show the result of the other algorithms:


## Model Generality
As we mentioned in the article that we trained the datasets by exluding a single source/domain and test the dataset of this source/domain to verify that the training model is generic. In our article, we have already shown the results of random forest, we show the results of the other algorithms below:
